Soundex

Language: Java
Status: Complete

What this program does:
Soundex is an algorithm or a way of coding names based on their sound rather than their spelling.
A useful historical and research record, this program reads in a list of names and creates their
soundex keys. Other than making the keys this program uses a TreeMap to store, sort and search through
the data.


To Run:
Download the source files
and open in a Java editor or IDE.
Run the soundex app.


Ideas:
While this project is complete there are some ideas for anyone who wants to revisit this project.
This project reads in names from a text file and can add names for the duration of a session.
However, what if someone wants to permenantly add that name for their future run sessions. Adding a 
save function would prove beneficial for ease of use. Another possibility is to create an actual database for the name data.
